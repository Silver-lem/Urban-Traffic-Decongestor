AI Traffic Decongestor 

Overview
The AI Traffic Decongestor is a smart navigation assistant designed to reduce traffic congestion by providing AI-driven route recommendations. Unlike traditional GPS systems, our solution combines real-time traffic, weather, toll data, and event feeds with AI-powered reasoning to generate context-aware routes and predictive insights.
Built for the Hackathon, this prototype demonstrates how AI + APIs + intuitive UI can work together to solve one of India’s most pressing urban mobility challenges.

Key Features
Predictive Traffic Insights – Forecast traffic congestion using event + weather data.
Smart Routing – Suggest routes that minimize congestion, toll delays, and accident-prone areas.
Conversational Query System – Users can type natural queries like “Find me a toll-free route to Guntur”.
Lightweight Frontend – Responsive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth interaction.
Flask Backend API – Orchestrates data flow, integrates AI API, and serves recommendations.

Tech Stack
Backend: Flask (Python), Requests, Dotenv
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AI Layer: Gemini/OpenAI API (natural language understanding + recommendation generation)
Deployment: Local Flask server (scalable to cloud)

How It Works
User Input:
1) User enters their starting point, destination, and traffic status in the web app.
2) Flask Backend: It builds a prompt → sends to AI API.
   - Receives the request via /get_recommendation.
   - Constructs a natural language prompt describing the context.
   - Sends it to the AI model (Gemini/OpenAI API) for processing.
3) AI returns clear driving recommendation.
4) Frontend displays suggestion dynamically.


AI Processing:
The AI model acts as a GPS navigation expert, analyzing the data.
Returns a clear, concise driving recommendation (best route + reasoning).
Frontend Display:
The route recommendation is dynamically displayed on the UI.
Future scope: integrate live map rendering + real-time updates.

Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-traffic-decongestor.git
cd ai-traffic-decongestor

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add API Key
Create a .env file in the root directory:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Run the Server
python new.py

5. Access the App
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000


Feasibility & Next Steps

1) Scalability: Deploy backend on AWS/GCP/Azure with auto-scaling microservices.
2) Integration: Connect to real traffic APIs (Google Maps, HERE, TomTom) and event APIs (BookMyShow, weather).
3) User Growth: Start with commuters in urban areas, then scale to logistics fleets & government smart-city systems.
4) Multi-Modal Support: Add voice assistant + mobile app for hands-free navigation.

Impact

If scaled, this system can reduce congestion
save commute time
and lower fuel consumption
for millions of daily commuters.
By combining AI + real-time data, we envision a smarter, greener, and less stressful commuting experience.
